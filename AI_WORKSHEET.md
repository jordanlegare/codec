# CODEC AI Worksheet

Canonical work loop for ChatGPT, Codex, and other agentic contributors.

**Purpose:** complete one bounded unit of work without overstating capability, weakening CODA truth semantics, or coupling CODEC core to one profile.

> Read `README.md` first. Read deeper design docs only when the task touches their subject. Do not reread large historical plans unless they are directly relevant.

## Active work record — Stage F.3

```yaml
task: Add bounded object-store placement descriptors and exact record retrieval for F.1 partitions while preserving F.2 execution and generic truth semantics.
base_ref: origin/main
base_head_sha: c685cdcc06518478cb7390b3abfc71f2cdc32692
work_branch: automation/stage-f3-object-store-retrieval
current_version: 0.2.0
active_roadmap_stage: F — F.1 exact-work partitioning and F.2 bounded worker execution are merged; exact storage placement/materialization is the next unmet dependency.
continuity_evidence:
  - git_head: main at c685cdcc06518478cb7390b3abfc71f2cdc32692
  - open_prs: preserve unrelated work; F.3 uses its own branch/PR
  - exact_head_ci: F.2 final head de963a367457439bc6445bd50af0479b8c803beb passed CI 233 before merge
  - roadmap_issue: issue 10 records F.2 complete and object-store retrieval next
roadmap_issue_title: CODEC v1.0 roadmap execution log
scope: distributed
touched_truth_classes: []
current_behavior_verified_from: [code, tests, cli, changelog]
new_capability_claim: A caller can bind exact F.1 record links to opaque object-store ranges, retrieve each range through a caller-supplied backend under explicit bounds, verify exact record SHA-256, and hand the resulting ExtractedRecord batch unchanged to F.2.
change_class: generic_stream_abstraction
```

```text
BEFORE: F.1 identifies exact work and F.2 executes materialized exact records, but CODEC has no generic storage-placement/read boundary that can materialize a partition from object-store ranges.
AFTER: retrieve_partition_records validates one exact F.1 partition plus ordered placement descriptors before provider I/O, reads each exact range once through a caller-supplied backend, verifies length and SHA-256, and returns records directly consumable by F.2.
```

```yaml
proof:
  regression_test: tests/test_distributed_retrieval.cpp plus unchanged F.1/F.2 and all existing tests
  exactness_test: partition CDP1/link order/payload total plus each retrieved range length and SHA-256 must verify before success
  compatibility_test: F.1 CDP1 bytes, F.2 execution, CODA, S0/S1/D, provenance, Stage E, C ABI, CLI, and installed package behavior remain compatible
  failure_path_test: malformed/tampered placement descriptors, exceeded bounds, provider errors, short/long ranges, and wrong content fail closed with no retry or partial result
  security_test: store/key/version/backend labels remain descriptive placement metadata only; no credential, authorization, authentication, attestation, or storage-proof claim
  benchmark: n/a — no throughput, latency, scale, availability, durability, fault-tolerance, or cost claim
```

Invariant decisions:

- [x] S0/S1/D semantics remain unchanged; F.3 only materializes exact bytes already identified by physical record hashes.
- [x] F.1 partition identity remains independent of archive/object placement; CDP1 bytes do not change.
- [x] Original RecordInfo.file_offset is preserved as record metadata and is never used as the object-store byte offset.
- [x] Complete descriptor preflight occurs before the first backend range read.
- [x] Returned range length and SHA-256 verify before a record enters the success result.
- [x] No cloud SDK/client, upload/write path, distributed index, backend registry, scheduler, RPC execution, retry/failover, automatic persistence, deployment integration, or scale claim is introduced.

## 0.5. Cold-start state recovery

Never assume a previous chat, local branch name, or scheduled task describes the current repository state.

- [ ] Record the exact checked-out HEAD and confirm the intended base branch is current before editing.
- [ ] Inspect the working tree and preserve unrelated changes.
- [ ] When GitHub access is available, inspect open pull requests, their head SHAs, reviews, and CI; do not duplicate or overwrite active work.
- [ ] Search open and closed issues for the exact title `CODEC v1.0 roadmap execution log`. If exactly one exists, read it and compare it with code/tests rather than treating it as runtime truth; if none or multiple exist, record that state instead of guessing.
- [ ] Select the active roadmap stage from merged implementation evidence and identify its next unmet exit gate. Dates alone never advance a stage.
- [ ] Record any unavailable continuity source and proceed only from evidence you can verify.
- [ ] Re-read state and reverify if the base or PR head moves before merge.

## 1. Read the minimum necessary context

- [ ] `README.md` manifest and invariants.
- [ ] `CMakeLists.txt` for version, targets, dependencies, test surface.
- [ ] Relevant public headers in `include/`.
- [ ] Relevant implementation under `src/`.
- [ ] Relevant tests under `tests/`.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` when changing released/user-visible behavior.
- [ ] Stream-first design spec only if the task affects architecture/core-profile boundaries.

Record the existing behavior in one sentence before changing it:

```text
BEFORE: <observable current behavior and evidence>
AFTER:  <observable intended behavior>
```

## 2. Classify the change

Choose exactly one primary class:

```yaml
change_class:
  - preservation_invariant
  - archive_format_or_compatibility
  - generic_stream_abstraction
  - profile_specific_behavior
  - inference_or_derived_output
  - security_or_authorization
  - performance_or_scale
  - documentation_only
```

Then answer:

- [ ] Is this generic CODEC/CODA behavior or profile-specific behavior?
- [ ] If profile-specific, is every profile-only field/assumption kept out of generic core structures?
- [ ] Does the change alter S0, S1, or D semantics? If yes, stop and validate against the architecture spec before implementation.
- [ ] Does it create a new capability claim? If yes, define the exact test that proves the claim.

## 3. Non-negotiable invariants

Every implementation MUST satisfy all applicable items:

- [ ] S0 remains the exact accepted source representation.
- [ ] S1 is used only for a deterministic, profile-defined exact canonical state.
- [ ] D remains visibly derived and provenance-bearing.
- [ ] No D artifact silently replaces S0/S1.
- [ ] Committed preservation does not depend on optional inference/profile success.
- [ ] Logical stream identity is not bound to a port, file, worker, connection, or archive segment.
- [ ] Unknown compatible payload types remain preservable/extractable.
- [ ] Generic records do not gain profile-only semantics without a universal reason.
- [ ] Unavailable functionality returns explicit unavailability; no fabricated output.
- [ ] Scale/performance claims include workload and hardware evidence.

If any item cannot be satisfied, do not work around it silently; revise the design or narrow the claim.

## 4. Test contract before implementation

Define proof first.

```yaml
proof:
  regression_test: <test/file or none for docs-only>
  exactness_test: <required for new S0/S1 claim or n/a>
  compatibility_test: <required for archive/API compatibility change or n/a>
  failure_path_test: <expected failure/unavailability path or n/a>
  security_test: <boundary test or n/a>
  benchmark: <required for performance/scale claim or n/a>
```

For behavior changes:

- [ ] Add/identify a test that fails for the old behavior and proves the requested behavior.
- [ ] Verify corruption/truncation/unknown-type behavior when archive semantics change.
- [ ] Verify overload/unavailable-model behavior when inference/profile execution changes.
- [ ] Verify C ABI/API compatibility when public interfaces change.

For documentation-only changes:

- [ ] Cross-check every current-status claim against code/CMake/tests.
- [ ] Mark every aspirational capability as planned/not implemented.
- [ ] Avoid duplicating large specifications already linked elsewhere.

## 5. Implementation loop

Use the smallest coherent change that satisfies the proof contract.

1. Change tests/proof first when behavior is modified.
2. Implement the minimum generic primitive or profile-scoped behavior.
3. Keep preservation and inference/profile processing separable.
4. Update public API/CLI/docs only when implementation requires it.
5. Update status/CHANGELOG when a capability actually changes.
6. Re-read the diff for accidental scope expansion.

Prefer:

```text
generic Stream primitive
  -> profile extension
  -> tested implementation
```

over:

```text
profile convenience
  -> audio/media assumption in core
  -> later architectural repair
```

## 6. Mandatory local/CI-equivalent verification

Release configuration:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCODEC_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=ON
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Sanitizers:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-san -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DCODEC_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=ON -DCODEC_ENABLE_SANITIZERS=ON
cmake --build build-san --parallel
ctest --test-dir build-san --output-on-failure
```

Capability sanity check when CLI behavior is relevant:

```bash
./build/codec capabilities
```

Verification record:

```yaml
verification:
  release_configure: pass | fail | n/a
  release_build: pass | fail | n/a
  tests: pass | fail | n/a
  sanitizer_build: pass | fail | n/a
  sanitizer_tests: pass | fail | n/a
  cli_capabilities: pass | fail | n/a
  targeted_proof: pass | fail | n/a
```

Never report success from an older run or a different commit.

## 7. Claim audit

Before opening/merging a PR, classify every changed capability statement:

| Claim type | Allowed wording |
|---|---|
| Proven by current code/tests | `implemented`, with exact scope |
| Interface exists, backend absent | `interface available; implementation/model unavailable` |
| Designed but not coded | `planned`, `architectural direction`, or `not implemented` |
| Probabilistic inference | confidence/quality + provenance; never deterministic source truth |
| Cryptographic signature | authenticates the signed statement only |
| Recovery | specify encoded-data recovery vs pre-lossy reconstruction separately |
| Scale | state measured workload/hardware; never infer from identifier/port capacity |

- [ ] README manifest still matches runtime truth.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` matches user-visible implementation changes.
- [ ] No comment/docs claim exceeds test evidence.

## 8. Diff audit

Before PR creation:

- [ ] Only intended files changed.
- [ ] No credentials, keys, generated artifacts, build outputs, or temporary automation files.
- [ ] No unrelated refactor.
- [ ] Generic/profile boundary remains clean.
- [ ] Public compatibility changes are explicit and versioned where required.
- [ ] No `TODO`/placeholder substitutes for required behavior.

Summarize the diff in at most five bullets.

## 9. Merge gate

A branch is merge-ready only when all applicable conditions are true:

```yaml
merge_gate:
  requested_behavior_proven: true
  invariants_preserved: true
  release_ci_equivalent_green: true
  sanitizer_ci_equivalent_green: true
  docs_and_status_truthful: true
  diff_scoped: true
  pr_mergeable: true
  ci_green_on_exact_head_sha: true
```

**Automatic merge rule:** merge only the exact head SHA whose required CI completed successfully. If the head moves, re-verify. If any gate is false/unknown, do not merge.

## 10. Completion report

Use this compact format:

```yaml
result:
  outcome: <what changed>
  files: [<paths>]
  proof: <tests/CI evidence>
  capability_delta: <newly implemented behavior or none>
  remaining_planned: <relevant unimplemented items>
  merge_commit: <sha or not-merged>
```

Do not repeat design history. Report facts from the final verified tree.
